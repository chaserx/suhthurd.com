The obligatory "Hello World" post. 

Blogging like a hacker using "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to generate static pages. Deployed under "Sinatra":http://sinatrarb.com and hosted on "Heroku":http://heroku.com .

I have no idea how this will unfold, but that's the fun part.

Let's test out the code highlighting feature.

{% highlight ruby %}
def HelloWorld
  puts 'Well, Hello World!'
end
{% endhighlight %}
