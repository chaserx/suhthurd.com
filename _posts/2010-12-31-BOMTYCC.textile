BOMTYCC (Bite Off More Than You Can Chew)

BOMTYCC. Powerful advice from "Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/, co-founder of "GitHub":http://github.com.

I recently watched the "video":http://confreaks.net/videos/432-rubyconf2010-the-road-from-ruby-hacker-to-entrepreneur of Tom's presentation from RubyConf 2010 entitled: "The Road from Ruby Hacker to Entrepreneur". 

Tom outlines his journey from anonymous Ruby hacker to successful entrepreneur. A recurring theme to his journey was his willingness to BOMTYCC. 

Perhaps without realizing it, I've been practicing BOMTYCC too. 

BOMTYCC it ...

-  is an ethic.
-  is a positive force behind learning.
-  enables you to follow that little urge which says "why not?"
-  makes building stuff fun. 

On this last day of 2010, I hope to have more BOMTYCC in the coming year. Perhaps, one more step in my own journey from biologist seduced by computers to a successful craftsman and maybe even entrepreneur.
