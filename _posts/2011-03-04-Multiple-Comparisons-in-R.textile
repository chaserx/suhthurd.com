I've been after this for quite some time... how to determine a letter designation between groups using "R":http://www.r-project.org/.

I ran across this package yesterday. Works well for single-factor data. 

"multcompView":http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multcompView/ "PDF":http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multcompView/multcompView.pdf


{% highlight r %}
  multcompBoxplot(Response ~ Treatment, d,
  horizontal=TRUE, compFn="TukeyHSD",
  sortFn="mean", decreasing=TRUE,
  plotList=list(boxplot=list(
  fig=c(0, 0.75, 0, 1)),
  multcompTs=list(fig=c(0.7, 0.85, 0, 1)),
  multcompLetters=list(
  fig=c(0.87, 0.97, 0.03, 0.98), fontsize=20,
  fontface="bold") ) )
{% endhighlight %}
