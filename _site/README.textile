h1. This is the data for my blog

Southard => Suh' thurd

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site.

h1. Deployment

"Jekyll Deployment":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/deployment

Jekyll powers GitHub pages. This could have easily been hosted there. "GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com/ 

But, the static output in the _site folder could easily just be rsync'd or ftp'd to any shared hosting provider. "rsync":http://github.com/henrik/henrik.nyh.se/blob/master/tasks/deploy or "glynn - ftp for jekyll":http://github.com/dmathieu/glynn

There's also "rack-jekyll":http://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll#readme

However, I'm going to try to deploy to Heroku using Sinatra just as "Jesse Storimer":http://jstorimer.com/2009/12/29/jekyll-on-heroku.html did. This seems simple enough with some flexibility.
